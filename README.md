## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I wanted this project to be more review for HTML/CSS, and I learned a lot of small but important details about CSS: 

- Make sure `<div>`s for elements are used as a last resort. For example, text content should have `<p>` tags which denotes hierarchy better.
- alt text for purely decorative images can be left blank, but otherwise, alt text should be as descriptive as possible so they are meaningful.

### Useful resources

- [Importance of HTML tag hierarchy for accessibility](https://writeandcodetime.com/blog/understanding-html-tag-hierarchy-for-improved-accessibility-with-code-examples) - This provided more clarity on the importance of the HTML tag hierarchy and why it is important to avoid misusing divs.
